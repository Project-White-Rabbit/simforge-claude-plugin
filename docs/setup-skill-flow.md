## Key invariants the diagram enforces

0. **Preamble runs once, only in `all` mode.** The explanation block (CODE → TRACES → DATASETS → IMPROVE, primitives, phase summary) renders verbatim at the start of `/bitfab:setup` / `/bitfab:setup all`, then flows directly into Login. No confirmation step, no marker file — sub-modes (`login`, `instrument`, `replay`) skip it entirely because the user has already chosen a phase.

1. **One workflow per Instrument cycle.** Step 8 takes exactly one workflow. The "next workflow" loop from step 13 always returns to step 8 — never to a parallel branch. This means one trace function, one trace plan, one set of code changes per cycle.

2. **Trace boundary = outer workflow, not the SDK/agent call.** The root must be re-invokable by the replay harness as a plain lambda with serialized inputs — so it must own its state setup, not consume a pre-built framework/stateful object (compiled graphs, configured SDK clients, DB sessions). Step 6 fixes the root as the outer workflow function (API handler, message processor, job runner, pipeline coordinator) that builds the framework + invokes it + processes the output. The agent SDK's `run()` / `invoke()` is never the root when there's a clear caller above it. Step 7 explicitly looks for work above / alongside / below any agent or SDK call so step 8's scope description and step 10's trace plan reflect end-to-end coverage, not just SDK internals.

3. **Trace processor SDKs default to hybrid plans.** When the SDK registers a processor (OpenAI Agents SDK, etc.), step 10a defaults to a hybrid plan: manual `●` spans wrap the workflow, the SDK call appears as one `(agent)` child whose grandchildren are `[auto]` lines, and other manual spans capture work above/alongside/below the SDK call. The bare auto-only plan is reserved for the rare case where the workflow truly is just the SDK call.

3a. **One flow = one trace function key.** Step 10a forbids a second key that covers the same flow. When an outer `@bitfab.span` / `withSpan` / `bitfab_span` and a framework handler (LangGraph callback, Claude Agent SDK handler) wrap the same work, they must share the same key. Separate trace functions are for reusable sub-components with their own standalone root.

4. **Purely additive instrumentation.** Step 10a builds the trace plan under the constraint that the tree must be implementable without behavior changes. If a candidate tree requires `await`-ing a stream that wasn't awaited, delaying a call, reordering, blocking a callback, or restructuring control flow, the tree is invalid — restructure the *tree* (siblings, separate cycles, flatter shape), not the code.

5. **Trace plan presentation is gated.** The trace plan is never shown until the additive check passes (10a → 10b). Behavior-changing approaches are never offered as options.

6. **Skill mode gates.** `login` mode stops after the Login phase. `instrument` mode stops after the Instrument loop completes. `all` mode flows through login → instrument → replay (Modify is **not** part of `all`). `modify` mode jumps straight to Modify and does not auto-continue to Replay. `replay` mode jumps straight to Replay.

7. **Replay coverage is computed before action.** The Replay phase reads the current state first (existing keys + existing scripts), then takes one of three branches: all covered → stop, missing keys → add, none exist → create. No user prompt on any branch.

8. **Replay functions call real code.** Each pipeline's replay function imports and invokes the actual instrumented function — never a stub. Factory-created functions are wrapped by calling the factory with mocks for closure dependencies (stream writers, session objects).

9. **Standalone-invokability is a static check, not a runtime one.** Step 5 reasons from the instrumented function's signature and dependencies to decide if it can be called from the replay script — it never executes the script to verify. If the function takes HTTP req/res objects, reads middleware-injected state, or needs a live server, it's not standalone-invokable. Refactor (extract a pure core and move the trace wrap to it) is the recommended resolution; the "leave as-is" path requires a header comment flagging the infra dependency.

10. **Serializable inputs are a trace-boundary constraint, not a replay concern.** Step 6 forbids picking a root whose inputs can't be serialized by the SDK's language-native tracing layer (TS/JSON, Python/JSON via Pydantic, Ruby/`to_json`, Go/`json.Marshal`). Live browser objects, HTTP req/res, stream writers, sockets, middleware-carrying request contexts, open file handles, and live DB connections all fail this test. Step 8 surfaces the violation as part of the workflow entry and requires the user to pick **move boundary inward** or **refactor upfront** before step 9. The Replay-phase step 5 is only a safety net; the primary gate is at instrument time, not after code has been written.

11. **Refactors require a plan + second confirmation, and are labeled by flavor.** When the user picks "refactor" (or any option that modifies existing functions/call sites), the skill must first present a refactor plan labeled as **visibility** (extract + export, logic unchanged — most cases) or **structural** (new pure-core fn with serializable inputs — rare overall, common for realtime/streaming/browser apps). The plan lists source fn, extracted fn signature, trace wrap location, every rewritten call site. Then AskUserQuestion (`Apply` / `Cancel`) before touching code; Cancel returns to the originating AskUserQuestion. Does NOT apply to step 11a's purely-additive instrumentation or step 11b's new-file replay pipeline writes — only to paths that modify existing code.

12. **Replay is unconditional in `all` mode, and non-interactive once entered.** After Instrument step 13 option D in `all` mode, Replay always runs as a coverage-verification/backfill sweep. Replay does not depend on traces existing — it reads trace function keys from code. Once inside Replay, there is no "Skip" branch: missing scripts get added and absent scripts get created without asking. The only Replay terminal state besides completion is "scripts exist and cover all keys, stop."

13. **Instrumentation and replay pipeline are generated concurrently via subagent delegation.** Step 11 fans out into 11a (main agent: instrumentation edits) and 11b (subagent: replay pipeline for this cycle's trace function key), dispatched in a single message. The subagent — spawned via `Agent(subagent_type="general-purpose")` with a self-contained brief (key, root signature, import path, existing/target replay script path, Replay non-negotiables, SDK `#replay` URL) — generates its code in parallel with the main agent's. This is the key shift: parallel `Edit` calls alone only overlap millisecond file writes, whereas a subagent overlaps the seconds-to-minutes of token generation. The replay subagent is skipped for Go-only projects (Go does not support replay). The trace plan's `Files changed:` list covers both halves, including the new/edited replay script path. The Replay phase therefore typically runs as a sweep that confirms everything is already wired up; it still exists to catch pre-existing trace function keys (added outside the skill or before this step was parallelized) and to verify Replay Output Contract compliance, including that every script emits the full `ReplayResult` (with per-item `durationMs`/`duration_ms`, `tokens`, `model`) as a single JSON block.

14. **Step 13 is a mandatory AskUserQuestion stop, and the only caller of `search_traces`.** The skill never silently transitions from Instrument to Replay; an empty `search_traces` result means "offer option A," not "skip." Replay does not check for traces — scripts are created from trace function keys in code.

15. **One trace function and one direction per Modify cycle.** Modify step 2 picks exactly one trace function; Modify step 4 picks exactly one of the five directions (add context / increase depth / reduce depth / move root upstream / move root downstream). Mixing directions or batching trace functions is forbidden — the user loops via the Modify step 9 menu if they want more.

16. **Purely additive modifications.** Modify step 5 enforces the same additive constraint as Instrument step 10a: if the chosen direction would require a behavior change, the direction is rejected (the user picks a different direction or splits into multiple cycles). Removing a `withSpan`/`@span` wrapper is the only structural edit allowed, and only under direction 3 (Reduce depth), and only when the underlying call stays intact.

17. **Before/after diff is gated on the same additive check.** Modify step 6 is only reached after step 5 proves the direction is additive; the diff is never shown alongside a behavior-changing option.

18. **Key rename is an explicit user decision.** Directions 4 and 5 (root moves) always prompt for keep-or-rename at Modify step 7. Directions 1–3 never prompt — the key is preserved.

## How to update

When `commands/setup.md` changes (steps added, removed, reordered, or branching changes), update the Mermaid block above and re-render to verify. The diagram and the skill must agree — they document the same flow.

Same edits should be mirrored to `bitfab-cursor-plugin/skills/bitfab-setup/SKILL.md` and `bitfab-codex-plugin/skills/setup/SKILL.md` per the CLAUDE.md plugin sync rule. The codex skill carries platform-specific extras (`BITFAB_PLUGIN_DIR` resolution, ticket-channel + browser-launch-failure rules, Blocking-process polling rule) that stay codex-only.
