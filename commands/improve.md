# Bitfab Improve

Use the local plugin MCP tools (`mcp__plugin_bitfab_Bitfab__list_trace_functions`, `mcp__plugin_bitfab_Bitfab__search_traces`, `mcp__plugin_bitfab_Bitfab__read_traces`, `mcp__plugin_bitfab_Bitfab__update_agent_labels`) to find what's failing in a traced function, gather labeled failed traces, then iterate on the code/prompts using replay until pass rates improve.

**MCP tools:** This skill uses `list_trace_functions`, `search_traces`, `read_traces`, and `update_agent_labels` from the **local plugin MCP server** (bundled with this plugin). Do NOT use the remote Bitfab MCP tools (`mcp__Simforge__*` or `mcp__Bitfab__*`) — use only the `mcp__plugin_bitfab_Bitfab__*` variants.

**Always use** `AskUserQuestion` **when asking questions, reporting results, or presenting choices.** Never print a question as text and wait. Rules:

- Recommend an option first, explain why in one line
- Present 2-5 concrete options
- One decision per question — never batch

This skill has three invocation modes. `all` walks every phase. The two sub-modes do one focused thing each — building a labeled dataset, or running experiments against an existing one — and require the trace function key as the argument because they skip the function picker (Phase 1) and instrumentation/replay verification (Phase 2).

| Invocation | Action |
|---|---|
| `/bitfab:improve` or `/bitfab:improve all` | Full flow: pick function → verify instrumentation → label dataset → diagnose → iterate → wrap up |
| `/bitfab:improve dataset <key>` | Build or extend the labeled dataset for one function, then stop. No experiments run |
| `/bitfab:improve experiment <key>` | Run experiments to fix failing traces against an existing labeled dataset, then wrap up. No dataset labeling happens here — if the function has no validated dataset yet, run `/bitfab:improve dataset <key>` first |

In sub-modes, grep the codebase for `<key>` early so labeling and experiments are grounded in the actual instrumented function (the full flow does this in Phase 2; sub-modes skip Phase 2 entirely).


## Phase 1: Identify the Trace Function

**Run only when mode is `all`.**

If a `traceFunctionKey` was provided as an argument, skip the listing and the user prompt — but still cross-check the provided key against the local codebase before moving on. Otherwise, work through all four steps below:

1. **Skip this step if a `traceFunctionKey` argument was provided** — use the argument directly and continue to cross-check. Otherwise, call `mcp__plugin_bitfab_Bitfab__list_trace_functions` to list all available trace functions. Use **only** the keys and metadata returned (trace counts, last activity) — do NOT invent or infer descriptions of what each function does from its key name. Key names are often ambiguous or misleading, and guessing produces hallucinated descriptions that confuse the user.
2. **Cross-check each key against the local codebase** before presenting. For each returned key, `grep` the repo for string-literal uses of that exact key (across `*.ts`, `*.tsx`, `*.py`, `*.rb`, `*.go`, `*.baml`). Mark each function in the presented list as:

   - **✅ instrumented here** — found in this repo, with the file path
   - **⚠️ not found in this repo** — traces exist on Bitfab but the key isn't in this codebase (likely another repo or a renamed key)
3. **Skip this step if a `traceFunctionKey` argument was provided** — there's no list to present. Otherwise, present the full list in the question text showing ONLY: `<key>` · `<trace count>` · `<last activity>` · `<instrumented-here marker + path, or not-found marker>`. No invented summaries.
4. **Skip this step if a `traceFunctionKey` argument was provided** — the function is already chosen. Otherwise, use `AskUserQuestion` with 2 options: the recommended function (prefer one that is ✅ instrumented here AND has recent activity) and a free-text "Type a function key" option. If nothing is instrumented here, say so explicitly in the question — don't hide it.

## Phase 2: Verify Instrumentation & Replay

**Run only when mode is `all`.**

Check that this trace function has both instrumentation and a replay script.

1. Search the codebase for the trace function key to find where the SDK is used:

   - TypeScript: `grep -r "<traceFunctionKey>" --include="*.ts" --include="*.tsx"`
   - Python: `grep -r "<traceFunctionKey>" --include="*.py"`
   - Ruby: `grep -r "<traceFunctionKey>" --include="*.rb"`
   - Go: `grep -r "<traceFunctionKey>" --include="*.go"`

   If the key is found, note the file location — this is the code you'll iterate on in later phases.

   If the key is NOT found in the codebase, the function is instrumented elsewhere (the traces exist on Bitfab). Use `AskUserQuestion` to ask:

   > "I can't find `<traceFunctionKey>` in this codebase — it may be instrumented in another repo or under a different key."
   >
   > A) **Instrument now** — set up tracing in this codebase *(recommended)*
   > B) **Continue anyway** — work with the traces even without local code
   > C) **Pick a different function**
   > D) **Stop**

   If the user chooses **"Instrument now"**, invoke `/bitfab:setup instrument` using the Skill tool, then verify whether a replay script exists for this function. If **"Continue anyway"**, skip the replay-script check and start building the dataset — there's no local code to iterate on yet.
2. Search for a replay script that covers this trace function:

   - Look for files matching `scripts/replay.*`, `scripts/*replay*`, or any file that imports `bitfab.replay` / `client.replay`
   - Read the script and check that it maps the target trace function key

   If a replay script exists but targets a different function key, do NOT modify the existing script or suggest changing the code's function key. Instead, treat it as "no replay script for this function" and offer to create a new one.

   If no replay script exists or it doesn't cover this function, use `AskUserQuestion`:

   > "No replay script found for `<traceFunctionKey>`."
   >
   > A) **Create replay now** — create the replay script inline *(recommended)*
   > B) **Pick a different function**
   > C) **Stop**

   If the user chooses **"Create replay now"**, invoke `/bitfab:setup replay` using the Skill tool, then start building the dataset.

## Phase 3: Build Dataset via Labeling

**Run only when mode is `all` or `dataset`.**

Build a dataset of labeled traces. If there are already enough validated traces, use them directly. Otherwise, the agent labels candidate traces and opens the labeling page for the user to approve or correct them.

In `dataset` mode this phase is the entry point — Phase 1 (function picker) and Phase 2 (instrumentation/replay verification) are skipped, so the trace function key comes from the argument. Before calling `mcp__plugin_bitfab_Bitfab__search_traces`, grep the codebase for the key (e.g. `grep -r "<traceFunctionKey>" --include="*.ts" --include="*.tsx" --include="*.py" --include="*.rb" --include="*.go" --include="*.baml"`) and note the file path — every later step ("Label them yourself", and Phase 4 "Read the code" in `all` mode) needs it.

1. **Check existing validated traces** — Use `mcp__plugin_bitfab_Bitfab__search_traces` with `validated: true` to find traces with validated labels (human-authored, or agent-authored and approved by a human). Count them, and check whether at least one is a failing label. Present the summary to the user via `AskUserQuestion` (e.g., "Found 8 validated traces (3 pass, 5 fail). Do you want to label more, or proceed with this dataset?"). Note: `search_traces` excludes replayed traces (traces from test runs) by default — leave `includeReplays` off when labeling, since replays have new inputs (not the original production inputs) and shouldn't be mixed in with the traces you're labeling.

   > A) **Use these validated traces** — proceed with the existing dataset
   > B) **Label more traces** — add more labels before proceeding *(recommended)*
2. **Find unlabeled traces** — If more labels are needed, search again without label filters to find unlabeled traces. Use `mcp__plugin_bitfab_Bitfab__read_traces` with `scope: "summary"` to read them and identify which are worth labeling — look for diverse inputs, traces that produced output (not empty), and traces that cover different scenarios. Filter out near-duplicates and uninteresting traces.
3. **Present candidates** — Use `AskUserQuestion` to show which unlabeled traces you recommend labeling and why. Include the already-labeled trace count for context (e.g., "4 traces already labeled, recommending 5 more for labeling"). Let the user approve, adjust, or skip.
4. **Label them yourself FIRST (mandatory before opening the labeling page)** — Once the user approves the candidate traces, **you** label them. Call `mcp__plugin_bitfab_Bitfab__read_traces` with `scope: "full"` on the approved trace IDs (batch them — up to 10 per call), read each trace's inputs / output / spans yourself, and decide for each one whether it looks like a PASS or a FAIL. **Ground your judgment in the codebase, not just the trace text.** Before you start labeling, read the instrumented function in the user's source (located in Phase 2 in `all` mode, or via the grep step in this phase's intro in `dataset` mode) and any nearby code that explains intent — comments, docstrings, README sections, related tests, BAML files — so you know what the function is *supposed* to do and what "good" looks like for it. Apply the same context to every trace: does this output achieve the function's goal as expressed in the code? Does it match the patterns in the already-validated traces? Then call `mcp__plugin_bitfab_Bitfab__update_agent_labels` once with an array of `{ traceId, label, annotation }` objects — **both `label` (true for pass, false for fail) and `annotation` (a one-or-two-sentence explanation written for the human reviewer, ideally referencing what the code is trying to do) are required for every trace**. Commit to a verdict — if you genuinely cannot decide, you didn't read the trace or the code carefully enough. The labels you save here start unapproved; they only become part of the validated dataset once a human approves them in the labeling page.

   > 🚨 **HARD RULE — DO NOT SKIP:** You MUST call `mcp__plugin_bitfab_Bitfab__update_agent_labels` with verdicts for every approved trace BEFORE running `startDataset.js` to open the labeling page. Sending the user into the labeling page without pre-labeled verdicts is a process violation. This is non-negotiable.

   > **Made a mistake?** If you realize a verdict was wrong (e.g., you mislabeled a trace or want to re-evaluate), call `mcp__plugin_bitfab_Bitfab__update_agent_labels` again with `{ traceId, archive: true }` for those traces. The previous label is hidden (kept for audit), and you can re-label the trace from scratch with another `update_agent_labels` call.
5. **Open the labeling page** — Run the label script to open the labeling page in the browser:

   ```bash
   node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/dist/commands/startDataset.js" <functionKey>
   ```

   (`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` resolves to the plugin directory; `<functionKey>` is the trace function key.) This opens the labeling page showing agent-labeled traces awaiting approval and already-labeled traces. The user approves agent labels, relabels traces, or skips. The script blocks until the user clicks "Confirm dataset".
6. **Wait for labeling to complete** — The label script blocks until the user finishes and clicks "Confirm dataset". It prints a summary when done (e.g., "Labeling complete: 8/10 traces labeled").
7. **Build the dataset** — Call `mcp__plugin_bitfab_Bitfab__search_traces` with `validated: true` to get the final set of validated traces. Call `mcp__plugin_bitfab_Bitfab__read_traces` with all validated trace IDs and `scope: "full"` to get the full dataset with labels and annotations.
8. **Confirm the dataset** — Present the dataset via `AskUserQuestion`: each entry showing (trace ID, label, annotation summary). The dataset must contain at least one **validated failing label** — i.e. at least one trace where a human either authored or approved a `false` label. To check, call `mcp__plugin_bitfab_Bitfab__search_traces` restricted to the dataset trace IDs with `validated: true` and `labelResult: false`. Two outcomes:

   - **gate fails (no validated failing label — search returns nothing)** — tell the user and loop back to find or label more unlabeled traces
   - **gate passes (at least one validated failing label)** — get explicit approval, then continue

   Unapproved agent labels do **not** satisfy this gate by design — `validated: true` excludes them.
9. **Hold in-context** — This approved dataset is the benchmark for all experiments in Phase 5. Keep it in your working context throughout. In `dataset` mode the skill stops here — surface the dataset summary to the user and exit so they can pick up with `/bitfab:improve experiment <key>` later.

## Phase 4: Diagnose & Plan

**Run only when mode is `all`.**

1. **Understand failures.** Using the failed traces you read in Phase 3 (or read them now if you haven't):

   - Call `mcp__plugin_bitfab_Bitfab__read_traces` on 3–5 failed traces with `scope: "full"`

   Synthesize the failure patterns — what's going wrong, what the common threads are.
2. **Read the code.**

   - Find the instrumented function in the codebase (in `all` mode you found it in Phase 2; this step is unreachable in `dataset` / `experiment` modes)
   - Read the full implementation — follow the call chain to understand the logic
   - Identify **iteration targets**: prompts, system messages, parameters, preprocessing, postprocessing
   - If BAML files are involved, read the relevant `.baml` files
3. **Categorize fixes based on failure annotations.** Based on the failure patterns, the code, and the labeled dataset from Phase 3, categorize proposed changes into three buckets:

   **Bucket 1 — Code fixes**: Deterministic bugs (off-by-one, type mismatch, missing null check, wrong variable). These won't recur once fixed. Bundle all code fixes into a single experiment unless they are large feature changes. These are applied first as a foundation that all subsequent experiments build on.

   **Bucket 2 — Judgment-based fixes**: Prompt changes, context truncation, search tuning, output formatting, etc. These require the user's judgment to evaluate correctness. Each gets its own experiment.

   **Bucket 3 — Infrastructure proposals**: Larger changes that require new infrastructure, architectural changes, or significant feature work. These are separated out because experiments become harder to compare when some include large infra changes and others don't — apples-to-apples comparison requires a consistent baseline. Do not run experiments for these. Instead, if the user has integrations (Linear, Notion, Jira), propose creating a task with a clear writeup for future work.

   Present the categorized plan via `AskUserQuestion`:

   > "Based on the N traces in the dataset, here's what I see:
   >
   > **Code fixes** (experiment #1 — bundled):
   >
   > - [Fix]: [What and why, which traces it addresses]
   >
   > **Judgment-based experiments** (#2, #3, ...):
   >
   > - [Experiment]: [What change, which traces it targets, hypothesis]
   >
   > **Future infrastructure** (not experiments):
   >
   > - [Proposal]: [What it would require, which traces it would help]
   >
   > I'll replay each experiment against the labeled dataset and evaluate using the annotations as acceptance criteria."

   Get the user's confirmation before proceeding.

## Phase 5: Iterate with Replay

Run an iterative improvement loop. If experiments are independent, fork them to subagents in parallel using the **Agent tool** with `isolation: "worktree"`; otherwise run sequentially. Each iteration:

1. **Run only when mode is `experiment`.**

   The trace function key comes from the argument and no prior phase has run. Rehydrate the dataset and locate the code before any experiment:

   1. **Grep the codebase** for the trace function key (e.g. `grep -r "<traceFunctionKey>" --include="*.ts" --include="*.tsx" --include="*.py" --include="*.rb" --include="*.go" --include="*.baml"`) and note the file path. This is the code you'll iterate on.
   2. **Fetch the validated dataset** — call `mcp__plugin_bitfab_Bitfab__search_traces` with `validated: true` to get the validated trace IDs for the function, then `mcp__plugin_bitfab_Bitfab__read_traces` with `scope: "full"` on those IDs to load labels + annotations into context.
   3. **Branch on the result:**

   - **no validated traces (or no validated failing labels)** — tell the user the function has no labeled dataset yet and recommend running `/bitfab:improve dataset <key>` first; stop the flow
   - **validated dataset loaded (≥1 failing label)** — summarize the dataset for the user (counts of pass/fail) and the failure annotations. Pick a first experiment from the failure patterns and continue
2. **Run only when mode is `all` or `experiment`.**

   **Make the change.**

   - Use `AskUserQuestion` to explain what you're changing and why, and confirm before editing
   - Edit the iteration target (prompt, code, tools, parameters)
3. **Run only when mode is `all` or `experiment`.**

   **Replay against the dataset.** Collect the trace IDs from the labeled dataset (built in Phase 3 in `all` mode, or rehydrated at the start of this phase in `experiment` mode). Run the replay script with those specific traces.

   ```bash
   # The exact command depends on the replay script — adapt to what exists
   # Example for TypeScript:
   cd <project-dir> && npx tsx scripts/replay.ts <pipeline-name> --trace-ids <id1>,<id2>,<id3>,...
   ```

   **Before running: verify the replay script prints the full original and new output values to stdout for every item** (not just lengths, counts, hashes, or truncated previews). If it doesn't, fix the script first — the Replay Output Contract and example script live in the SDK reference at `https://docs.bitfab.ai/<language>-sdk#replay`. Subagents can't evaluate an improvement from `5 → 7 (+2)`.
4. **Run only when mode is `all` or `experiment`.**

   **Evaluate against labels & annotations.** Read the replay output. For each trace in the dataset, use the label (pass/fail) and annotation (from Phase 3, or rehydrated at the start of this phase in `experiment` mode) to judge whether the new output is an improvement:

   - For traces labeled **fail**: Does the new output address the issue described in the annotation? The annotation explains what went wrong — use it as the acceptance criteria.
   - For traces labeled **pass**: Did the replay preserve the correct behavior, or did it regress?
   - Record the results into a tmp file if the dataset/context is too big so you can recall it later easily.
   - Return the results of the sub agent if you are in one to the main agent.
5. **Run only when mode is `all` or `experiment`.**

   **Share results to the user.**

   > "After N experiments these are the results: X/Y traces now pass.
   >
   > - ✅ Trace `abc123`: Now passes — [how the annotation's issue was resolved]
   > - ❌ Trace `def456`: Still failing — annotation said [X], output still [Y]
   > - ❌⚠️ Trace `ghi789`: Was passing, now failing (regression)"

   Show this across the full data set, and highlight the best outcome concisely. Explain why it worked best with references to code, docs, and/or research if needed. For the best outcome:

   - **If pass rate improved and no regressions**: use `AskUserQuestion` to confirm whether they want to keep iterating or stop
   - **If pass rate improved but regressions exist or no improvement**: tell the user and propose to create a plan for new experiments and continue iterating.

   Ensure your question includes your recommended next step.

   > A) **Keep iterating** — run another experiment from the plan *(recommended)*
   > B) **Stop and wrap up** — move to the final summary

## Phase 6: Validate & Wrap Up

**Run only when mode is `all` or `experiment`.**

1. **Summary.** Use `AskUserQuestion` to present the final results similar to this. You may expand where appropriate based on context from the user:

   > "**Improvement summary for** `<traceFunctionKey>`:
   >
   > - Failed traces fixed: X/Y (from N% → M% pass rate on labeled failures)
   > - Full replay pass rate: A/B
   > - Changes made:
   >   - [File]: [Description of change]
   >   - [File]: [Description of change]
   >
   > The changes are in your working tree (not committed). Review the diffs and commit when ready."
