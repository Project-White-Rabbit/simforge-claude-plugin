# Simforge Login

Run the login script to authenticate with Simforge. This will open your browser to sign in, save your credentials locally, and auto-configure the Simforge MCP server.

```bash
node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/dist/commands/login.js"
```

After the script completes, confirm the result to the user. If successful, say "You're authenticated with Simforge. Restart Claude Code to activate the MCP tools." If it failed, show the error message.
