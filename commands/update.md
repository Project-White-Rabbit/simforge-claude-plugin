# Bitfab Update

Update the Bitfab plugin and/or every workspace's SDK in the current project.

| Invocation | What runs |
|---|---|
| `/bitfab:update` or `/bitfab:update all` | Plugin update **and** SDK update per workspace |
| `/bitfab:update plugin` | Plugin update only — skips all SDK steps |
| `/bitfab:update sdk` | SDK update only — skips the plugin check |

## 1. Run the update script

Pass the mode argument the user invoked through to the script (omit for the default `all`):

```bash
node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/dist/commands/update.js" <mode>
```

- For `/bitfab:update plugin`, run with `plugin`.
- For `/bitfab:update sdk`, run with `sdk`.
- For `/bitfab:update` or `/bitfab:update all`, run with no argument (or `all`).

The script does up to two things depending on mode:
- **Plugin phase** (`all` or `plugin`) — updates the plugin if a newer version is available.
- **SDK phase** (`all` or `sdk`) — queries the registry for the latest SDK version and prints a `<bitfab-sdk-status>` block with one JSON entry per `(workspace, language)` pair. Falls back to the baked snapshot (set `remoteCheckFailed: true`) if the registry lookup fails.

## 2. Report the plugin result

**Skip this step if mode is `sdk`.** If the plugin was updated, remind the user to restart Claude Code to apply the update. If the mode was `plugin`, stop here — do not run steps 3-6.

## 3. Parse the SDK status

**Skip this step and everything below if mode is `plugin`.**

Each line inside `<bitfab-sdk-status>` is a JSON object with fields:

- `workspacePath` — relative path of the workspace from the repo root (`"."` for non-monorepos or the root package itself)
- `language` — `"typescript" | "python" | "ruby" | "go"`
- `packageName` — the SDK package name (`bitfab`, `bitfab-py`, `bitfab`, `github.com/Project-White-Rabbit/bitfab-go`)
- `declaredVersion` — the range from the workspace's manifest. May be `null` or a loose range.
- `resolvedVersion` — the exact version from the lockfile (workspace's own lockfile, or the monorepo root lockfile used as fallback). This is the truth — what the user is actually running.
- `current` — `resolvedVersion ?? declaredVersion`. Use this for user-facing messages.
- `latest` — the latest published version (from the source indicated by `latestSource`)
- `latestSource` — `"remote"` (fetched live from the registry) or `"baked"` (snapshot from the plugin build)
- `remoteCheckFailed` — `true` when the live registry lookup failed; trigger the agent fallback (step 5)
- `updateAvailable` — `true` only when `latest > current`
- `manifestPath` / `lockfilePath` — absolute paths of the files the info came from

If there are **no lines** inside `<bitfab-sdk-status>`, the programmatic check found no SDK — but don't stop yet, run step 4 first. If **every entry** has `updateAvailable: false` and step 4 finds no extras, tell the user their SDKs are up to date and stop.

## 4. Verify with an agent pass (always)

The programmatic detection is regex-based and only knows the workspace formats we hand-coded (pnpm/npm/yarn workspaces, uv workspaces, go.work). It can miss unusual monorepo layouts, vendored SDKs, or projects using package managers we don't parse. **Always run this verification** before offering updates.

- Grep the project for SDK imports (run these in parallel):
  - TypeScript: `import .* from ["']bitfab["']` or `require\(["']bitfab["']\)`
  - Python: `^\s*(from|import) bitfab\b`
  - Ruby: `require ['"]bitfab['"]`
  - Go: `"github.com/Project-White-Rabbit/bitfab-go"`
- For each import, find its workspace directory by walking up to the nearest `package.json` / `pyproject.toml` / `Gemfile` / `go.mod`.
- Compare that set against the `workspacePath` values in `<bitfab-sdk-status>`.
- For each workspace that has imports but **no** corresponding status entry, treat it as a missed detection: ask the user which package manager that workspace uses, then go to step 5 for it (same flow as `remoteCheckFailed: true`).
- If the sets match, proceed.

## 5. Agent fallback for `remoteCheckFailed` or detection gaps

For each entry where `remoteCheckFailed: true`, or any workspace discovered only in step 4, run the package manager's native outdated command from the workspace directory. The command is authoritative — it respects private registries, mirrors, and offline caches.

| Language | Detection (from workspace/repo) | Command (run from workspace dir) |
|---|---|---|
| typescript | `pnpm-lock.yaml` at repo root → pnpm; `yarn.lock` → yarn; `bun.lock` → bun; otherwise npm | `pnpm outdated bitfab --json` / `npm outdated bitfab --json` / `yarn outdated bitfab` / `bun outdated bitfab` |
| python | `uv.lock` → uv; `poetry.lock` → poetry; otherwise pip | `uv pip list --outdated --format=json` / `poetry show -o bitfab-py` / `pip list --outdated --format=json` |
| ruby | `Gemfile.lock` | `bundle outdated bitfab --parseable` |
| go | `go.mod` | `go list -m -u -json github.com/Project-White-Rabbit/bitfab-go` |

Use the real latest from the command's output in place of `latest` when deciding whether to offer an upgrade.

## 6. Offer to update, one workspace at a time

For each entry with `updateAvailable: true` (after step 4 + 5 reconciliation), ask the user with `AskUserQuestion` — **one decision per question**:

> We recommend **Update**: `<workspacePath>` — `<language>` SDK `<current>` → `<latest>`.
>
> A) **Update** — run the package manager update command now *(recommended)*
> B) **Skip** — leave this workspace on `<current>`

If there are 3+ outdated workspaces, first ask a batch question:

> A) **Update all N outdated workspaces** *(recommended)*
> B) **Ask me per workspace**
> C) **Skip everything**

**Always recommend "Update" (option A) for every outdated workspace.** Do not downgrade the recommendation based on the range specifier or lockfile shape — not for `workspace:*` / `workspace:^`, not for git refs, not for pinned `"=X.Y.Z"`, not for path deps. An outdated SDK is an outdated SDK. If the user is working inside a monorepo where the dep is workspace-linked to a sibling SDK package, they are free to pick **Skip** themselves, but the recommended action is still **Update**. The only exception: when `updateAvailable: false` the entry shouldn't be in the prompt at all.

On `Update` / `Update all`, detect the package manager from the lockfiles and run the update **from the workspace directory** (not repo root — matters in monorepos):

| Language | Command |
|---|---|
| typescript | `pnpm update bitfab@latest` / `yarn upgrade bitfab@latest` / `bun update bitfab` / `npm install bitfab@latest` |
| python | `uv add bitfab-py@latest` / `poetry add bitfab-py@latest` / `pip install -U bitfab-py` (and bump the pin in `requirements.txt` via Edit) |
| ruby | `bundle update bitfab` |
| go | `go get github.com/Project-White-Rabbit/bitfab-go@latest && go mod tidy` |

After each update, Read the manifest to verify the new version and confirm to the user.

If every outdated SDK is skipped, acknowledge and stop.
